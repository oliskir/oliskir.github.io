# [](#header-1) Bio

I have a [PhD](http://phys.au.dk/fileadmin/site_files/publikationer/phd/Oliver_Kirsebom.pdf) in Nuclear Physics from [Aarhus University](http://phys.au.dk/), Denmark. Between 2010 and 2018 I was employed as Postdoc at [TRIUMF](https://www.triumf.ca/) (2010-13) and as Assitant Professor at [Aarhus University](http://phys.au.dk/) (2013-18) on a grant from the [Villum Foundation](https://veluxfoundations.dk/en). During these years, I was a frequent visitor at large international accelerator laboratories such as [CERN](https://home.cern/) in Switzerland and led a number succesful experimental collaborations. My research focused on the study of nuclear properties important to our understanding of stars, stellar evolution and the origin of the elements. Eager to put my analytical skills and knowledge of physics to use in a more applied setting, I took up a new position in June 2018 as acoustic data analyst at [MERIDIAN](https://meridian.cs.dal.ca/).
