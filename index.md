# [](#header-1) Brief bio

I have a PhD in Nuclear Physics from [Aarhus University](http://phys.au.dk/), Denmark. 

Between 2010 and 2018 I was doing research in nuclear physics, first as 
a postdoc at [TRIUMF](https://www.triumf.ca/) (2010-13) and more recently as an Assitant Professor 
at [Aarhus University](http://phys.au.dk/) (2013-18).

During these years, I was a frequent visitor at large internationl accelerator laboratories 
such as [CERN](https://home.cern/) in Switzerland and led a number succesful experimental collaborations.

My research focused on the study of nuclear properties important to our understanding of stars, 
stellar evolution and the origin of the elements.

Wanting to put my scientific knowledge and analytical skills to use in a more applied context, 
I took up a new position in June 2018 as acoustic data analyst at [MERIDIAN](https://meridian.cs.dal.ca/).
